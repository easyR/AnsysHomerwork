Homework 1
1. Elaborate a Finite Element model of the Pratt truss bridge shown in the figure in order to determine nodal deflection, reaction forces and axial stresses
 Top chord
Top lateral bracing
        Bottom chord Struts Sway bracing
  The two bottom chords are subjected to a vertical distributed load with intensity of 20000 N/m. The dimensions are given in mm. One side of the bridge is pinned-supported, the other is roller-supported. The trusses have the following cross-sectional areas:
Bottom chord, top chord, struts: A1 = 1000 mm2 Sway bracing: A2 = 600 mm2
Top lateral bracing: A3 = 400 mm2
Material: steel E=210 GPa ν=0.3

Homework 1
Δy1 Δy2 Δy1
    2. The shape of the bridge is then modified by moving the y coordinate of the nodes of the top chord by Δy1 and Δy2 as shown in the figure. Determine the values of Δy1 and Δy2 that minimize the maximum deflection
